2. Introduction: This project is a medical chatbot built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique.
   The chatbot is designed to provide accurate and quick medical information by combining data from the Faiss vector database and a large language model (LLM).
   This medical chatbot aims to offer medical consultation support through a chat interface. By utilizing the RAG technique, the chatbot can retrieve relevant documents from the database and generate responses based on the retrieved information.
3. Technologies Used:
    - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Combines information retrieval with text generation.
    - **Faiss:** A fast and efficient vector database library used for storing and querying information.
    - **Python Flask:** A lightweight backend framework for building APIs and handling user requests.
    - **LLM (Large Language Model):** Used for embedding and processing natural language.
4. Features
    - Retrieve medical information from the vector database.
    - Provide quick and accurate responses based on retrieved data.
    - Interact through an easy-to-use chat interface.
5. Installation
